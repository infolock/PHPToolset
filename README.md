PHPToolset
==========

Just a collection of PHP scripts that I have built over the past 12 years while coding PHP.

This is a repo that will grow over time as I have time to dig through them and upload them.

One final note:
Granted, I'm giving this code out to the public in hopes that it is either helpful to someone, or can be used as a running joke on a smarter developer's blog.

But hey, should the chance that this code actually do you good and you feel compelled to say, buy me a beer or something - I may be so inclined to accept =)

``Commenting``
This code is probably missing some commenting.  I'll try to update it as I have time.

``License``
This code is distributed under the terms and conditions of the [MIT license](LICENSE).


Enjoy! :neckbeard:
