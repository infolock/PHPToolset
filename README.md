PHPToolset
==========

Just a collection of PHP scripts that I have built over the past 12 years while coding PHP.


## Contents

This section will have to be updated.  For now just know this:

* **CS_Terminal_fun** is a directory containing some CS-related theory.
* **classes** is a direcotry containing...well, yeah. classes. 
* **terminal_tools** is a collection of terminal tools I created for making some maintenance-level ops better.

## Notes

This is a repo that will grow over time as I have time to dig through them and upload them.

Granted, I'm giving this code out to the public in hopes that it is either helpful to someone, or can be used as a running joke on a smarter developer's blog.

But hey, should the chance that this code actually do you good and you feel compelled to say, buy me a beer or something - I may be so inclined to accept =)

## Commenting
This code is probably missing some commenting.  I'll try to update it as I have time.

## DataOCD
The [DataOCD Github Repository](https://github.com/dataocd) is also a sister repository my cousin (James Phillips) and I worked on for a hot second.  Contains some pretty cool stuff relating to RESTful ROA services if you're looking for that sort of thing.

* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/jhibbard) - Wanna connect with me?  Send me an invite - always looking for fellow developers to network with.
* [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com/infolock) - Some comments I'm proud of, others not so much.  Reader beware >:)


Enjoy! :neckbeard:

PS: I'm a noob at markdown with github.  If you decide to do one and you find yourself feeling like a noob as I did, checkout the [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).  I dunno why there isn't a direct link to this (or something similar!!!!) example on the page you edit a file in - but there should be.
